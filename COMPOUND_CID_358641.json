PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Of particular note, gram-negative bacillary meningitis caused by organisms only moderately susceptible to third generation cephalosporins (eg, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens) or resistant to these antibiotics (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas cepacia) may be candidates for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy if the organisms are susceptible. This combination may be an effective alternative to ampicillin (or penicillin G) with or without an aminoglycoside for the treatment of meningitis and bacteremia caused by Listeria monocytogenes. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may be useful for the treatment of infective endocarditis caused by Coxiella burnetii. In a double-blind, randomized, prospective study, intravenous trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (640 mg/3200 mg daily) was shown to be as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, including bacteremias, endocarditis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. The details of this study have not been published, however, and some consultants expressed concern about the use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in deep-seated staphylococcal infections (eg, endocarditis) because this combination may only be bacteriostatic against this organism. Currently, each of these indications is considered investigational.",

This is logical, since a microoganism that has acquired resistance to one of the components may still be killed by the other. Trimethoprim-resistant microorganisms may arise by mutation. Resistance in gram-negative bacteria is often associated with the acquisiton of a plasmid that codes for an altered dihydrofolate reductase. Resistance to trimethoprim in Staphylococcus aureus appears to be determined by a chromosomal gene rather than by a plasmid. The development of resistance to the combination also occurs in vivo. Resistance of Staphylococcus aureus increased from 0.4% to 12.6% during one 5-year period of use. In New York, 10 to 20% of gram-negative microorganisms were found to be resistant.",

Daily doses were evenly divided and orally administered every 6 h for 3 days. Trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and N4-acetylsulfamethoxazole concn in serum and urine were measured by HPLC. Five subjects withdrew from the study because of intolerable GI and CNS toxicities. In the seven subjects that completed the study, the mean maximum serum drug concn after the last dose were 13.6 + or - 2.0, 372 + or - 64, and 50.1 + or - 10.9 ug/ml for trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and N4-acetylsulfamethoxazole, respectively. The mean half-lives were 13.6 + or - 3.5, 14.0 + or - 2.3, and 18.6 + or - 4.3 hr, respectively. Changes in absolute neutrophil count were significantly correlated with the minimum concn of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in serum and trimethoprim area under the concn-time curve (for all three parameters, r2 = 0.6 and p < 0.05). These findings add to the evidence that serum drug concn in adults following the conventional dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia are excessive and contribute to certain adverse reactions.",

Renal dysfunction changes the pharmacokinetics of both component drugs. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole disposition are not significantly altered until creatinine clearance is less than 30 ml/min, when sulfamethoxazole metabolites and trimethoprim accumulate and may lead to toxicity. Renal dysfunction, however, does not preclude the use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to treat susceptible infections, even when creatinine clearance is less than 15 ml/min. Adverse effects may occur more frequently in renally impaired patients but are not clearly related to increased serum concentrations of either drug. Guidelines for appropriate dosing and monitoring of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy in these patients are presented.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Trimethoprim subsequently acts to inhibit the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to the metabolically active tetrahydrofolic acid by the enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase.

Patients who had significant levels of sulfamethoxazole reactive IgE antibodies in their sera did not have IgE antibodies that reacted with trimethoprim-Sepharose. Inhibition experiments with a number of sulfonamides to determine the fine structural specificities of the sulfamethoxazole reactive IgE antibodies in three patients revealed that sulfamethoxazole and, depending on the serum, sulfamerazine and sulfamethizole, were the most potent inhibitors of IgE binding, whereas the parent sulfonamide, sulfanilamide, was a very poor inhibitor. From a detailed examination of structure-activity relationships, we concluded that the 5-methyl-3-isoxazolyl group on the sulfamethoxazole molecule was the allergenic determinant for all three patients with the 5-methyl group being particularly important for IgE antibody recognition. The assays for the detection of IgE antibodies to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should prove useful for the diagnosis of immediate hypersensitivity to co-trimoxazole and perhaps for monitoring drug therapy in AIDS patients where a high incidence of adverse reactions to co-trimoxazole has been reported.",

There are not many well controlled studies on the use of sulfamethoxazole only in human pregnancy. Sulfamethoxazole is part of a group of medications called sulfonamides. Some studies have suggested the use of sulfonamides during the first trimester may be associated with an increased chance for birth defects while other studies have not.Concern has also been raised with the use of trimethoprim in pregnancy. There have been studies involving several hundred individuals using this medication at any time in pregnancy. Some studies have not found an increased chance for birth defects. However, a few studies looking at trimethoprim used with a sulfonamide during the first trimester have found an increased chance for birth defects, including heart defects, neural tube defects (opening in the spine), cleft lip or palate, and urinary tract defects.Trimethoprim may lower the level of folic acid in your body. Folic acid is a B vitamin that helps the body make new healthy cells and may help reduce the chance of certain birth defects, like spina bifida, in the baby. It is recommended that people who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy consume between 400-800 micrograms of folic acid each day from foods or vitamin supplements. If sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim is taken during the first trimester, your healthcare provider may suggest that you take more folic acid. You can talk with them about how much folic acid is right for you.Use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim after the first trimester is not associated with a higher chance of birth defects in the baby. Overall, if there is an increased chance for birth defects with use of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim during pregnancy, it appears to be small.",

About 75% of the untoward effects involve the skin. These are typical of those known to be produced by sulfonamides.
